 Appends the `string` to the receiver using `font`.  This will attempt to do a good job with all the various font characteristis, but is a fairly basic mechanism. If you have more complicate stings, consider using `-[NSBezierPAth appendBezierPathWithAttributedString:]`, as that allows more complex typography.

 Draw the string into the current graphics context. This is mostly here to help support old API usage, and it isn't really considered the ideal way to render a string. You should really consider using the methods on `NSString` and `NSMutableString`. They'll produce superior results.

 Still, this method is simple and straight forward, and can be useful for debugging. Avoid using it for final production code.

 Appends a cross to the receiver centered at `center`. You can control the size of the legs of the cross via the `legSize` and `legThickness` parameters. Note that the thickness should be less than the size, you'll get some interesting results.

 Returns an path enumerator you can uset to enumerate the path. The enumerator has a couple of interfaces that let you interact in different ways, but the two important ones are `-[AJRPathEnumerator nextElementWithPoints:]` and `-[AJRBezierPath nextLineSegmentIsNewSubpath]`, the latter of which will return the path flattened. When using the latter, make sure you consider setting the `error` property of the enumerator, as this will affect the quality of the flattened path.
