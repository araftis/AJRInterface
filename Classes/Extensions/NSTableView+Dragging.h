 @abstract Delegate method to reorder rows in your datasource when the table reorders rows.
 @discussion Have your delegate implement this method if you want to allow rows to reorder. This method does one of two things. First, if it allows it, it reorders it's own representation of the rows and returns YES. This allows the table view to move the rows in real time while the user drags.
 
 If the delegate does not want the table view to re-order the rows, then it should just return NO from this method and the rows will not re-arrange.

/*!
 @abstract Delegate method to allow/disallow row dragging.
 @discussion Implement this method if you want to sometimes (or always) prevent the rows in a table view from being move.  You can use this if you have a class which is a delegate of multiple table views, and you only want some of them to have rows which are movable.  You can also use it if a table view can only have its rows rearranged sometimes.  Return YES to allow rows to be moved, or NO if rows cannot be moved for the given table view.  If you implement tableView:moveRowAtIndex:toIndex:, and do not implement this method, YES is ajrsumed.
