 @abstract The Factory and superclass of all fill classes.
 @discussion This class is used as both the factory for getting instances of fills, but is also the common superclass of all fills in the system. You can use fills to fill either rectangles or paths when drawing. Some of our classes use fills to provide a nice, generic manner in which to identify and perform fills. For example, the AJRBox class uses fills.
 
 When implemented a fill, you generally need to implement three classes in your subclass. At minimum, your class should look like this:
 <PRE>
    + (void)load
    {
        [AJRFill regsiterFill:self];
    }
 
    + (NSString *)name
    {
        return @"My Fill";
    }
 
    - (void)fillPath:(NSBezierPath *)path
    {
        &gt;draw your fill here!&lt;
    }
 </PRE>
 Other than that, you can optionally implement the -fillRect: method if you can draw your fill more quickly knowing you're filling a rectangle. This may or may not be true for your subclass. If it's not true, then you only need to implement the -fillPath: method.
 
 Likewise, when chaging one of your fill's properties, you should call -willUpdate and -didUpdate. For example, say your fill has a color property. You should then implement your -setColor: method as follows:
 <PRE>
    - (void)setColor:(NSString *)color
    {
        if (_color != color) {
            [self willUpdate];
            [_color release];
            _color = [color retain];
            s[self didUpdate];
        }
    }
 </PRE>
