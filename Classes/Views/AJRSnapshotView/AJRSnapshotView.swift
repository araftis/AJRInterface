/**
 Creates a snapshow of the passed in view and then renders that snapshot.

 This class is useful when you need to temporarily create a static snapshot of a view to then display it in the view hierarchy. For example, you might want to animate two view swapping, and it's a lot more efficient to animate a snapshow of the views rather than animating the views drawing themseles each time.
